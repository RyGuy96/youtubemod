## About

Allows you to create a YouTube URL with multiple start and stop times to skip
over content you're not interested in. Natively, YouTube allows just one start and one end time. Amounts to the hacky use of the YouTube iframe API behind a borrowed html template to fix a "problem" which will never cross the minds of most people but which I and a select few found horribly frustrating.
